This is just a learning project for deepening my expertise in Nodejs. Through my previous experience, I found some issues which you can improve, here are those some points:-

1. Use debounce for google search place api, instead of every stroke
2. Optimize UI and Make reusable components
3. There are lots of UI issues like alignments and responsiveness.

My focus on this project was to learn more about Node.js and how a normal uber app works.
